basic git commands 

git init
git status
git add .
git reset .
git log
git log --oneline
git commit -m "commit message"
git push -u origin <branchName>
git remote add origin http-url
git pull -u origin <branchName>(only updates the branch name ,it doesn't bring the other branches name in scenario)
git pull (pull all the branches separately but update code for your current branch)
git branch <branchName> (creates new branch but doesn't switch to that)
git checkout <branchName> (switches to the created branch)
git switch <branchName> ((switches to the created branch) || more modern)
git checkout -b <branchName> (creates and switch on that branch)
git branch -M <branchName> (changing the current branch name)
git clone [repository]
[git fetch + git merge = git pull]

git pull --> if there commes conflict then you have to resolve , then only it will merge, otherwise, you cann't  switch branches even but you can do undo by -
git merge --abort (bcoz on;y fetch has performed and not merge so it is like undoing the essential merge)
git rm [file]: Removes a file from the working directory and stages the removal.
git remote -v: Lists remote repositories associated with the current repository.
git diff: Shows the differences between the working directory and the repository.
git switch -c <branch name> : creating new branch switching on it
